# Overview
The problem: A lot of international students go to University of Hawaii at Manoa. Because of the culture difference and language barrier, they usually have troubles to make friends in the campus.  As the interests of the international cultures rise, there are also a lot of in-state students who want to have international friends. However, there are no easy ways to connect those two groups of students to each other. 
The solution: The international bowl for University of Hawaii at Manoa will help students who are interested in learning new cultures and languages to build connections to international students who are willing to have local friends. UH Students can login to browse profiles with a brief description and find people who have similiar interests. In the website, they can also start conversations and set meetings for free.
