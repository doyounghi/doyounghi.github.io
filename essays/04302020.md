# Like A BusinessMan.
In our life, we all sometimes be a businessman/ want to be a businessman. That can be the result of watching television shows where rich businessmen come out and show what is exactly like living as a boss. In other hand, that also can be a human's nature. We all want to be outstanding and powerful. However, we all are not always good at business. It is the area of talents. Even though you have a great idea to make your business successful, there are many factors that you need to consider: locations, profitables, and so on. Great ideas are powerful but do not keep us from facing problems. Indeed, to be successful is to have the ability to solve a problem. The most important thing is the efficiency. Well, failures will teach us a lot of things, but it is not everybody who can get up and consider the failures just as "lessons." Here, we want to think about algorithms as software engineers. Algorithms are mostly related to solve problems that have certain patterns and to be efficiently figure the patterns out. Whether it is known or not, algorithms are able to be applied in everywhere. If you think about machine learnings, it is true. However, there are more areas that can be drastically efficient with algorithms. For example, biologists have reduced the significant amount of time to analyze DNA Patterns with pattern matching algorithms. However, we need to be more general to control the problems that can come out from anywhere. Among dangerous factors that can affect your company in the deadly way, there can be a great structure to solidify the company and save itself. Here, I would like to talk about design patterns. It is effective ways to solve the problems like algorithms but in more general ways. For exmaple, if I describe the two different concepts, algorithms are the work that your workers do but design patterns are the whole structure of your company. Design patterns actaully include algorithms, in other words. Therefore, we can say that learning design patterns is important to solve problems that come out in general.
