* The Uninvited Guest
    When I was getting ready to go to work on the early March, I faced the news saying, 'due to COVID-19 several states in USA ban people from dining in restuarants, bars, and etc.' It was not the first time that I heard about COVID-19. Working as a server in the local popular restauarnt in Ala moana where tourists are our main customers, I noticed the unexpected number of empty tables on Morning. So, I was not shocked by the news but scared, because my intuition was telling me, "COVID-19 will break your daily life down into the pieces. As all the bad things do, it unexpectedly comes to the world, like the uninvited guest. 

* From my memories
    "When I was clocking in on the day, I saw managers having the meeting with serious faces. Then, I realized that the premonition has become the reality of my life. I was born in 1996. I am not old enough to say about "when I was young.." but want to say that COVID-19 is not the first corona virus happening in the world. There were corona virus outbreaks such as "SARS" and "MERS" that caused a lot of victims. I remember that when South Korea had the first two MERS deaths on 2015, all the media was talking about the disease, and the president had to have press conferences everyday to update the people. All the doctors and nurses had to work 24/7, scarificing themselves to prevent the spread of the virus. Through the memories about MERS, I could feel that something bad is going to happen soon.
