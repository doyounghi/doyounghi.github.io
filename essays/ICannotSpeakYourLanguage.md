# Can you understand what I am saying?
Programming language always impresses me, regardless of what the language is. As I always have a fun to learn different languages other than my mother tongue, I think that it is like learn a new programming language. As each language has different grammars and conceives different cultures, there is the diversity in the computer programming language world.

# Java Script.. Who Are You?

Java Script was the language, which I knew but never had a chance to be familiar with. Because of my familiarity with Java, I just thought that Java Script should be like Java. However, as I learned it in ICS311, I have realized that Java Script is more like Python. The first word that I can say about Java Script is the convenience. The course has never gotten into the deep area including algorithm, but I think that Java Script is smart like Python. For example, even though you write messy codes in your script, you can just make it tidy with one click in the fiddle, which is different in Eclipse.
# I think I know who you are

Java script still has similar syntaxes as Java has. So, as the name implies, it will be easy to write codes in Java Script if you are familiar with Java. However, Java Script is considered as Front-End Language. The reason is that it is really connected to the browser. You do not have to download platforms such as eclipse and anaconda to use Java Script. You just need Google Chrome and Jfiddle.

# Front-End Java Script can be your friend!
Java Script is one of the most important languages to software Engineers, as they say. I think that they are right; Java Script is important. However, as we are always hard to learn a new language, it is difficult to learn a new computer language. From my experience,when I moved to Hawaii after graduating from High School in Korea, I could not speak any English. To break the language barrier down, I researched for the best way to learn a new language. A lot of linguists believe that the only way to learn a new language is to fail but speak.

In the context, the practice WODs should be appreciated. They are to provide the great opportunities to fail but learn something important, like you fail but speak. The only way to learn is to try to be better. Since checking the time is expected in the practice, it is helpful for us to know where we stay at and encourage us to be better. This learning way can be painful and stressful because mistakes and failures will follow, eventually, but will be important to lead us to the better Java Script Developer. Rainbow always appears in the sky after the harshest storm. I believe that through the challenges, we will see the better
